# Dash Files package

This package is meant to facilitate the construction of a whole from parts, in particular, datasets from many disparate files (e.g. in the case that it spans many files).  The user will be able to upload many csvs/excel files/parquet/etc having possibly overlapping columns, and piece them together into a datasets, all through a web-based interface.  The user can also download the data as one or more(?) files in any(?) format, and optionally appending enrichments made along the way.  Such enrichments will be outside the scope of this project and should be considered in apps that use this in part or whole as a starting point.

This project is also meant to help me test out the usage of packages like sqlalchemy, pydantic, dynaconf, etc.
